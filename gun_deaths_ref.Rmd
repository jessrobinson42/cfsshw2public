## Get the data

```{r}
# don't modify this chunk unless you still need to install rcfss
# if so, run "devtools::install_github("uc-cfss/rcfss")" in the console first

library(tidyverse)    # load tidyverse packages, including ggplot2
library(rcfss)

# load the data
data("gun_deaths")
gun_deaths
```

## Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of gun deaths per month.

### Print the data frame as a formatted `kable()` table.

```{r}

```

### Generate a bar chart with human-readable labels on the x-axis. That is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`.

```{r}

```

## Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of gun deaths associated with each type of intent cause of death. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest values.

```{r}

```

## Generate a boxplot visualizing the age of gun death victims, by sex. Print the average age of female gun death victims.

```{r}

```

## How many white males with at least a high school education were killed by guns in 2012?

```{r}

```

## Which season of the year has the most gun deaths?

Assume that:

* Winter = January-March
* Spring = April-June
* Summer = July-September
* Fall = October-December

```{r}

```

# Are whites who are killed by guns more likely to die because of suicide or homicide? How does this compare to blacks and hispanics?

```{r}

```

## Are police-involved gun deaths significantly different from other gun deaths? Assess the relationship between police involvement and age, police involvement and race, and the intersection of all three variables.

```{r}

```

## Session info
